# Weather Dashboard

## Description

[**View Demo**](https://agia.github.io/Weather-Dashboard)
</br>
</br>
A weather dashboard that shows various weather conditions for an inputted location.

The app runs in the browser, dynamically updating the HTML and CSS using vanilla JavaScript, and the Open Weather Map API for data, allowing the user to input a city, and get details of the current weather conditions for that city, as well as a five day forecast.

The app also saves previously entered cities into localStorage, and saves them to a displayed list, so on user interaction, the weather information for that particular city can be conveniently recalled and displayed.

## Usage

You can use the app directly via it's Github Pages deployment (found [**here**](https://agia.github.io/Weather-Dashboard) or by using the `View Demo` link above).
